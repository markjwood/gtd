# GTD

A 'getting things done' app.

This is a simple app created with React and TailwindCSS. It includes a todo list and a Pomodoro timer.

## Todo List

This is a basic todo list that includes an optional deadline for each todo. Todos can be marked complete by checking the checkbox, or deleted by clicking the 'x' next to each todo.

## Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro technique is a method of dividing work time into intervals separated by short breaks. By default, the "focus" sessions are 25 minutes and breaks are five minutes. Every fourth break is a longer break of 30 minutes. These settings can all be changed by the user by clicking the gear icon in the upper right corner of the timer.

Todos and timer settings are stored in localStorage.
